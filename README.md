# PowerSystem_RL_Attacks

This is the code repo for paper [Understanding the Safety Requirements for Learning-based Power Systems Operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04983).

We demonstrate for the power system control tasks, how deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms perform under adversarial attacks. We show that small perturbations over state observations can cause model-free learning algorithms output unsafe decisions.
